# README for bShop

This is the Readme for bShop.  Not much to see here, it is a web app that probably doesn't need to be a web app but I want to learn Rails so it will be a web app.

* Social Classifieds

I am making this as an alternative to the already well-established online classifieds sites. I think it would be a cool idea to incorporate a community aspect to it, to encourage quality, descriptive posts and discussion.

This is my first serious Rails app, so I'm learning as I'm going. I'll be working on this regularly, and all code pushed here will also be pushed to the Herokuapp site above simultaneously.
